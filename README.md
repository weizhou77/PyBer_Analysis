# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

In this PyBer analysis, we will create a summary dataframe to show all of the ride-sharing data by city type, such as Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver based on different city type. Also, we will create a line plot graph to compare the total weekly fare base on different city type. At the end, we will make some suggestions for the CEO for addressing any disparities based on the statistical information and graph. 

## Results :

1. From the table above, we can see that in the Total Rides column, Rural city type has the least rides and Urban city type has the most rides. The Urban city type has 13 times more rides than the Rural city type and 2.6 time more rides than the Suburban city type. It means that driver will have more opportunities in the Urban city type than the Rural and suburban city type.
2. From the Total Drivers column, although Urban cities have more opportunities, it is more competative also that the Urban cities have 30 times more drives than Rural cities and almost 5 times more drivers than Suburban cities. 
3. Since the Urban cities have the most rides, so the Total Fares for the Urban cities are the highest also. The total fares for the Urban cities are almost 10 times higher than the Rural cities' and 2 time more than the Suburban cities'.
4. Because the roads are not as convenient as the Urban cities and the Suburban cities, the Average Fare per ride for Rural cities is higher than Suburban cities and Urban cities which means that passengers will need to pay more to get to their destinations in the Rural cities than Suburban cities and Urban cities. 
5. Although the Rural cities have less total rides and total fares, they have less total drivers and the inconvenience of transportions make the Rural cities have the highest Average Fare per Driver. The Urban cities have the least Aberage Fare per Driver.

The line plot above shows the Total Weekly Fare by City Type. From the graph, we can see that the Urban line is on the top of other two lines which means that Urban cities have the highest Total Weekly Fare. The Surban line is in the middle and the Rural line is on the bottom.

## Summary:
1. Since the Average Fare per Driver is very low for the Urban cities, the company may consider to increase the fare for the Urban cities to help the driver to stay working in the Urban cities.
2. Since the Total Rides is greater than the Total Drivers for the Rural and Suburban cities, the company may consider to encourage Urban city drivers who live near the border of Rural and Suburban cities to drive in these two city types. 
3. Based on the line chart, we can see that some months have higher Total Fares than others. The company may consider to increase the fare charges for the slow months and decrease the fare charges for the busy months.
